        <Sent id="2.1">I think we should have something more concrete to meet about </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.2">- something that doesn't lend itself to list/telecon handling. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="2.3">Plus it would be extremely helpful if more than one WG met around the same time/place. </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.4">Not necessarily in conjunction with some "external" event.

        <Sent id="4.7">We would break out into small groups to create drafts and then gather as a whole group to review the drafts.
