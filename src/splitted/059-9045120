        <Sent id="1.1">Don't know how long this meeting is going to take but with a joint meeting &amp;quot;long&amp;quot; seems more likely than &amp;quot;short&amp;quot;. </Sent>

        <Sent id="1.3">I have another (phone) meeting coming up at 3:30 Boston time (1 hour after this one) so if we haven't finished by then, I'll have leave early. </Sent>

        <Sent id="2.2">Sorry about the delay, but this is the Techniques draft that I said I would do at the face-to-face. </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.3">It is not done but you will get the idea. </Sent>

        <Sent id="4.2">thanks for this </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.3">- it's a good piece of work. </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.4">How about we have the following categories: </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.5">+ Things you need to do to meet the checkpoint (these can be fairly general) </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.6">+ Techniques to do this (which should say how much of it they do) </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.7">+ Things which are good to do although they go beyond the requirements of the checkpoint. </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.8">+ References </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.9">These probably need to be sorted (where applicable) by tool type and priority. </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.10">For example to meet checkpoint 1.1 in a level-A tool, all that needs to be done is to provide source editing (and meet checkpoint 1.2 Preserve all accessibiltiy information, which can be done by not messing up the source). </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.11">But for a WYSIWYG tool this will not conform to 5.1 and 5.2, so the tool cannot get to double-A. </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.12">A source editing tool can use this technique to any level. </Sent>

        <Sent id="5.1">I agree. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.2">I'd really like to work on emphasizing cross-over situations in which doing one thing contributes to meeting several guidelines. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.3">In the end this could be pulled out into a separate list of techniques that need to be implemented as opposed to checkpoints that need to be met. </Sent>
