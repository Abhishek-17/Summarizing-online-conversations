        <Sent id="2.2">Why? </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.3">I view that anyone should be able to access information, regardless of whether or not they have a &amp;quot;disability.&amp;quot; </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.4">Your access shouldn't be _limited_ because you have a certain quality about you that other people don't have. </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.5">Regardless if we call that a &amp;quot;disability&amp;quot; or not, it should not interfere with your ability to access content on the Internet. </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.6">I think it's perfectly reasonable to define &amp;quot;accessibility&amp;quot; with having a strict definition of &amp;quot;disability&amp;quot; as long as your accessibility definition doesn't speak _only_ about access for people who fit that disability definition. </Sent>

        <Sent id="3.8">A disability is a consequence of design flaws in the environment. </Sent>
        <Sent id="3.9">Some individuals, due to accident, illness, or heredity, have difficulties performing -- or cannot perform -- certain tasks, such as moving their legs, seeing, hearing, talking, grasping or lifting. </Sent>
        <Sent id="3.10">When these functional limitations are severe enough to adversely affect a person's performance, and the natural and human environments fail to accommodate their functional limitations, the individual is said to have a disability.&amp;quot; </Sent>
        <Sent id="3.11">You take your pick. </Sent>
        <Sent id="3.12">If I were rewriting it, I would say something like this: </Sent>
