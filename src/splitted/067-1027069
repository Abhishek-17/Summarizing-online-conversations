        <Sent id="1.1">Question: Does a requirement to use graphics "when appropriate" -- something that may not be easily done by users with visual disabilities -- mean that blind people are not going to be "good" web designers? 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.2">Especially if we are going to expect them to be skilled in graphical user interface design and understand how to use images to communicate with people with cognitive disabilities? 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.3">If we adopted a "use graphics" requirement as a P1, would a blind designer be able to meet that requirement effectively?

</Sent>
        <Sent id="3.5">It's not the same, because a blind person can simply choose to -not- use an image if they feel they can't reasonably describe it...under the current guidelines. </Sent>
        <Sent id="3.6">(This changes when images become a -requirement for accessibility-.) 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="3.7">You do bring up a good point, however, that many people who can see are also not "visually capable" and may not be able to provide graphics easily. </Sent>

        <Sent id="5.1">&gt; If we adopted a "use graphics" requirement as a P1, would a blind designer be able to meet that requirement effectively? 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="5.2">There are lots of cases where a blind designer could use graphics as effectively, or actually more effectively, than a sighted person. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.3">These are cases where the graphics are selected or generated in a rule based or standardized way. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.4">For example, there are packages that generate flow charts from a textual description of a process. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.5">These insure a sensible flow chart... </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.6">at least a chart that "parses" correctly. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.7">On the other hand, I've seen too many flow chart style diagrams by sighted people where I have trouble understanding what conventions if any they're using.</Sent>
        <Sent id="5.8">I'll take a rule based design by a blind indivdiual any day. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="5.9">Other examples are graphs generated from data, schematic diagrams generated from pspice lists, and icons selected from a standardized set. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="5.10">Also, page layout and color selection can be made according to rules and standards. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="5.11">Now, what about more creatively artistic uses of design, uses that can't be reduced to mathematical or verbal rules? </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.12">Well, first of all that goes beyond our guidelines: </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.13">we're just looking at usability and I think rule-based graphics should handle that. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.14">Second of all, I think there are certainly some blind individuals who can produce better art than some sighted individuals (better than me for example), certainly among people who have some vision and early visual experience. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.15">As for art by people born blind... I'm not familiar with that area but I woudn't be surprised there's some remarkable use of shape and form.
