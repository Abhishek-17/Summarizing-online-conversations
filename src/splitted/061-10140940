        <Sent id="1.1">Hello Education and Outreach Colleagues, </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.2">I was talking to a friend today -- an amateur web developer and professional disability rights advocate -- who complained that the W3C guidelines are overly technical for her needs. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.3">She wants a plain language version of the guidelines. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.4">As she is fairly technologically savvy, she expressed frustration at having to work so hard to understand what must be done to make accessible web pages. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.5">To illustrate her point, she read me the Quick Tip card description of Image map. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.6">I agree with her, the tone is definitely geeky. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.7">But not everyone who develops web pages speaks the language of client-side servers and hotspots. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.8">I would guess that most people who develop web pages are amateurs (in the original sense of the word: from amore or amour: an activity done out of love.) </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.9">Will these people freeze when they read &amp;quot;make line by line reading sensible?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Use CSS?&amp;quot; </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.10">How about we create a &amp;quot;user-friendly&amp;quot; version of the Web Content guidelines? </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.11">Maybe a primer. </Sent>

        <Sent id="4.1">What about the WCAG Curriculum? </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.2">Particularly the Example Set of the WCAG Curriculum? </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.3">Curriculum: http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/wcag/ </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.4">Example set: http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/wcag/sam1-0.htm </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.5">Please note that the curriculum will be moving to W3C space in the next week or so. </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.6">Don't bookmark pages in the above site as they will soon be invalid. </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.7">Once the curriculum is in the W3C space, WAI EO will likely start promoting it more heavily. </Sent>
