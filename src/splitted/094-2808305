        <Sent id="4.1">charles' 5 line CSS tutorial... 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="4.2">to give a style to an element you list the element (called a selector in technical CSS writing), then in curly brackets you put the style feature you want to declare, a colon, and the value you want for that property. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="4.3">example: 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="4.4">BODY { font-size: 24pt } 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="4.5">To set several properties at the same time, use a semi-colon between each declaration, inside the same set of curly brackets. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="4.6">example: 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="4.7">H1 { font-size: 180% ; font-weight: bold ; line-height: 1.5em } 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="4.8">To make your statements override the ones that an author uses, add !important after each property declaration 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="4.9">example: 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="4.10">P { font-size: 12pt !important ; line-height: 2em !important } 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="4.11">NOTE: You should not do this in stylesheets that you publish, only your local stylesheet for reading, until the CSS2 cascade order is widely implemented. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="4.12">If your browser uses the CSS2 cascade order, this will be fine. </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.13">If not, then an author who has published a style sheet with !important will override yours. (sigh) 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="4.14">I don't know which cascade Amaya uses. </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.15">It does allow you to disable any style sheet attached to a document, which is a handy feature. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="4.16">Cheers

</Sent>
        <Sent id="4.27">I have used a stylesheet which works ok on my own editing at at my own site and on those where people are kind enough to let one choose for themself. </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.28">Unfortunately once someone's site chooses a color you are stuck with it... </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.29">I am suggesting that an override be provided as an ACCESSIBILITY issue. </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.30">Amaya can lead the way on this as it does on several other issues such as MathML. </Sent>
