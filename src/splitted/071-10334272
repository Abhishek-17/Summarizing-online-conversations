        <Sent id="1.1">Quick question. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.2">In earlier versions of Acrobat, it was not possible to make PDF files accessible if the files were actually developed on a Macintosh. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.3">Is this still the case with the latest version of Acrobat for the Mac (version 6.0, I believe)?

        <Sent id="5.1">Sailesh, 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="5.2">Make Accessible is a command that attempts to analyze an untagged PDF file and infer logical structure from the marks on the page. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.3">This would be used by an author who is trying to repair accessibility problems in an existing PDF file. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.4">The best analogy is that it is doing OCR on the logical strucure. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.5">Like OCR technology, it is imperfect, and the results should be reviewed and corrected, if necessary, by the author. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="5.6">In Acrobat 5, this command was only available on Windows. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.7">In Acrobat 6, it is available for both Mac and Windows. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="5.8">When the Adobe Reader 6.0 is presenting an untagged PDF file to assistive technology, it automatically runs MakeAccessible internally to infer logical structure. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.9">This can make loading an untagged PDF considerably slower than loading a tagged PDF, but makes it possible, for example, to read tables even in an untagged PDF.
