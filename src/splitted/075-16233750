        <Sent id="1.1">Hi, </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.2">So far, about 24 screen reader users have sent in votes. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.3">One person didn't like the screen reader version because of the long links. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.4">What he didn't realize was that the links were the same for both versions. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.5">He just hadn't run into them in the standard version before trying the version for screen reader users. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.6">Two other users forgot to make a choice. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.7">The remaining 21 users preferred the version formatted for screen readers over the standard version. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.8">A couple of people commented that they would want some more text on the screen reader version. </Sent>

        <Sent id="5.1">I don't get any unusual code (other than the CFM declaration at the top). </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.2">Otherwise it looks pretty normal, &amp;amp;amp; reads just fine with JFW3.5. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.3">A few small problems such as ALT text &amp;quot;pages\cleardot1.gif&amp;quot; (approx.), but nothing really unusual. </Sent>
