        <Sent id="5.3">I am pleased to announce that Allaire Corp will be our hosts, and look forward to a productive two days, and some time to say hi. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.4">The nitty-gritty... </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.5">Meeting registration is open from now until 1 October. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.6">register via the meeting page at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/f2f-oct99 which also provides details on location, accommodation, etc. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.7">There are a limited number of rooms available in the Royal Sonesta Hotel (which is the meeting venue) at a discounted rate </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.8">- in order to qualify for this rate reservations and meeting registration must be completed by September 10. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.9">Since October is the peak season for Boston hotels, rooms are expensive and hotels book out early, so you are advised to make your plans and reservations as soon as possible. </Sent>

        <Sent id="6.1">Most important - if you haven't registered yet, don't forget. </Sent>
        <Sent id="6.2">http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/f2f-oct99 for the details. </Sent>
        <Sent id="6.3">Given that there are a small number of us, I thought I would ask what people want to eat for lunch. </Sent>
        <Sent id="6.4">The default choices are roast turkey breast with vegetables (without turkey if you are a vegan), and pasta with vegetable rataouille. </Sent>
        <Sent id="6.5">Possible substitutions: </Sent>
        <Sent id="6.6">baked Scrod (fish) </Sent>
        <Sent id="6.7">chicken caesar salad </Sent>
        <Sent id="6.8">hommus roll-up sandwich with salad </Sent>
        <Sent id="6.9">salad with crab cakes </Sent>
        <Sent id="6.10">churrasco flank steak with chimichurri (??) and onions </Sent>
        <Sent id="6.11">I will do this in the following way: </Sent>
        <Sent id="6.12">If you cannot eat one of these things please make that very clear. </Sent>
        <Sent id="6.13">It will take at least two votes to change something, and will have to be compatible with what people can't do. </Sent>
        <Sent id="6.14">The deadline is 3pm (boston time) Monday. </Sent>
        <Sent id="6.15">No response will not be considered a vote for the default </Sent>
        <Sent id="6.16">- it will be considered a vote for &amp;quot;whatever gets chosen&amp;quot; </Sent>
        <Sent id="6.17">Sorry to bore you with administrivia, but I figure that having food that people like helps the meeting go well... </Sent>
        <Sent id="6.18">cheers </Sent>
