</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.7">&gt; Thank you for the url. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.8">&gt; I scanned through this fascinating site this morning and will forward this information to the ADA compliance officer who works with this project. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.9">&gt; Thanks, too, for asking about the effect of the animated gifs on people with epilepsy. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.10">&gt; This is the first time that I have ever seen such a question. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.11">&gt; I have a epilepsy from being electrocuted. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.12">&gt; I did not have difficulty with these animations. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.13">&gt; What triggers my seizures is color mixtures, especially any combination of red/blue/yellow, and the movements need to be fast like with a turning signal on a car ahead of me in a turning lane, an emergency vehicle, flashing advertising boards, and the like. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.14">&gt; Your gifs are slow, are black and white mostly, and are simple movements, not swaying or twirling. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.15">&gt; Again, good work! </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.16">&gt; I was doing my dissertation in the area of online instructional design and cognition. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.17">&gt; After my accident I had to change that. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.18">&gt; I'm pleased to see that someone is actually doing something to make reading and communication more possible in this text-heavy learning environment.

</Sent>
        <Sent id="2.2">WL: I wish I could understand the notion of making reading more possible within an environment that wasn't "text-heavy". </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.3">Perhaps it would be "nice" for people for whom text is a problem but just how is it "possible". 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="2.4">In at least the commonest definition of the word "read", the matter that one reads is "text". </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.5">I understand the part about "communication" not requiring a "text-heavy" environment, but not "reading". </Sent>

        <Sent id="3.2">This isn't necessarily the case, William. </Sent>
        <Sent id="3.3">There is a lot of reading that is non-textual. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="3.4">I _highly_ recommend, to everyone on this list, the book "Understanding Comics" by Scott McCloud. </Sent>
        <Sent id="3.5">It deals with the (U.S.) comic book medium and has some interesting thoughts and concepts on the "language of comics" as a blend between graphical and text media.
