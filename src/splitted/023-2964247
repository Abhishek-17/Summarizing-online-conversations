</Sent>
        <Sent id="5.3">I will sign up for an informal SIG at CHI. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.4">I haven't found out the time slots yet, but will try to today. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.5">For those of you who want to attend the sig, let me know if you have any hard constraints and I will try to sign up for a time to accommodate as many people as possible. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.6">Steven and I will also meet at CHI for planning purposes.

      <Text>
        <Sent id="6.1">The most convenient time to schedule the W3C UIG informal sig discussion is: Tuesday 4/8 1-2:30pm 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="6.2">This is the lunchtime slot. </Sent>
        <Sent id="6.3">I don't think we will need the entire 90 minutes so there will be time for lunch afterwards. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="6.4">As of Friday, this slot was still open for an informal SIG. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="6.5">If this is not available or there are conflicts, Wednesday 4/9 1-2:30 will be the backup. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="6.6">I will email the informal SIG people and get on the schedule this afternoon and confirm via this listserv. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="6.7">Hope to see you next week.
