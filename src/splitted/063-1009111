        <Sent id="1.1">Welcome to the Web Accessibility Initiative Evaluation and Repair (WAI-ER-IG) Interest Group (not to be confused with the overall WAI Interest Group (WAI-IG). </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.2">As you know from the charter, http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ we'll be advising the ER Working group on tools for evaluating, repairing, and filtering web sites (some people will be members of both groups). </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.3">In addition to our own knowledge and experience, we'll rely on input from from novice and expert users with disabilities, web authors and administrators, ISP's, content owners, and vendors</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.4">--some of whom will be ourselves. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.5">To start out, would you each say a few words about yourself and your involvement in this area? </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.6">I attached my own description below. </Sent>

        <Sent id="1.10">I'm Len Kasday. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.11">I had some opportunity to work on universal design while I was at AT&amp;amp;amp;T Bell Labs, e.g. designing the workstations at our Relay centers to accommodate communications assistants who are sighted, who use Braille, and who use a large screen and magnification. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.12">I'm now at the Institute on Disabilities at Temple University in Philadelphia. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.13">Also, I'm chair of this group. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.14">(When you write about yourself please feel free to be a lot longer or shorter than I was. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.15">Also, if your official job, i.e. your &amp;quot;day&amp;quot; job, isn't disability related, please mention it if you'd like to. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.16">It can be very helpful to get a different perspective). </Sent>

        <Sent id="2.3">My name is Daniel Dardailler and I work for W3C, acting as overall WAI Project Manager and also chair of the Evaluation&amp;amp;amp;Repair working group (Len is chairing the Interest Group). </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.4">My involvement in Accessibility goes back to 1993 or so, when I started working on X Window Access. </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.5">I started at W3C in 1996 and helped starting and launching the WAI in 1997. </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.6">I think the work we're about to do in these two complementary ER groups is paramount to the success of the WAI. </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.7">Furthermore, I expect the ER IG to be instrumental in defining and refining the exact deliverables of the WG group.</Sent>

        <Sent id="3.1">Hi, I'm Al Gilman. </Sent>
        <Sent id="3.2">When I joined the dev-access list I said &amp;quot;I'm a standards reformer, and I have an agenda.&amp;quot; </Sent>
        <Sent id="3.3">Maybe that was a little in-your-face, and then maybe I am. </Sent>
        <Sent id="3.4">General background is at &amp;amp;lt;http://www.access.digex.net/~asgilman/&amp;amp;gt; . </Sent>
        <Sent id="3.5">I am wearing at least two hats in this particular context. </Sent>
        <Sent id="3.6">Under one hat I am chairing the WAI Protocols and Formats Working Group. </Sent>
        <Sent id="3.7">I think we need to have some empirical backup for protocol and format suggestions we make in the future. </Sent>
        <Sent id="3.8">So I am looking to this group to brainstorm some things to try, and the ER-WG to prototype some of them, so that we can be more confident of our recommendations. </Sent>
        <Sent id="3.9">Under another hat I am on the Trace Center team that will be supporting NSF NPACI webmasters with a toolkit strongly related to the results of the ER teams in the WAI. </Sent>
        <Sent id="3.10">This has led me to be talking with webmasters and web evaluators in the U.S. Federal Government, which is a business headquartered near where I live. </Sent>
        <Sent id="3.11">I have been talking up this group with those folks. </Sent>

        <Sent id="6.2">My name is Kitch Barnicle and I work part time at the American Foundation for the Blind in the technology access program. </Sent>
        <Sent id="6.3">When I am not at AFB I live the life of a graduate student. </Sent>
        <Sent id="6.4">At the moment I am in the process of collecting data for my doctoral dissertation, which is basically a usability study of how users of speech interact with GUI elements. </Sent>
        <Sent id="6.5">In general, I am interested in adapting usability testing techniques so that individuals with disabilities can be included in assessments of mainstream technology, including the web. </Sent>
        <Sent id="6.6">Prior to joining AFB in the fall of 1993, I was a manager of evaluations at the federally funded rehabilitation engineering center on the evaluation of assistive technology. </Sent>
        <Sent id="6.7">Though our evaluations primarily focused on mobility related devices such as wheelchairs, scooters and bathroom equipment, I think the experience will prove useful to me in this endeavor. </Sent>
