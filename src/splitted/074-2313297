</Sent>
        <Sent id="4.2">MS-Word has elegant text-editing commands that are absent from a basic text editor, and that make editing documents a pleasure. </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.3">For example, you can quickly move entire lines or paragraphs without using the clipboard; 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="4.4">select words, sentences, and paragraphs by pressing a single key; </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.5">and undo and redo 100 levels. </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.6">All of the above can be done using keyboard and point-and-click techniques. </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.7">So there is a lot of versatility. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="4.8">Unfortunately, many of the really powerful Word commands are extremely poorly documented. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="4.9">Furthermore, savvy Word users can create special-purpose editing commands in Visual Basic to enhance the usefulness of the word processor as a text editor. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="4.10">Why use Word? </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.11">Because it is a good tool for the job.

        <Sent id="7.18">I suspect that *any* word processor would strip the ALT= text if you first save the document in its *native* format, then try to save it back to HTML. </Sent>

        <Sent id="8.1">&gt; I could test this on my system if you can confirm the scenario: 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="8.2">&gt; - Start with an HTML document, created by any means. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="8.3">&gt; - The doc contains an &amp;lt;IMG&amp;gt; with the ALT= attribute. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="8.4">&gt; - The HTML doc is opened in Word and some text on the page is changed or added. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="8.5">&gt; - The page is "Saved as HTML" from Word, without first saving it in Word format. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="8.6">I tried that with Word 97 and there was no lost of ALT. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="8.7">I even tried saving the file as .doc format, copying it under a different name.doc, reopening it in Word and saving it in HTML, and the ALT were still present (which proves that the ALT are somehow stored in the doc format) 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="8.8">On the other hand, there was a lost of longdesc, link, and others new HTML4 table attributes; </Sent>
        <Sent id="8.9">in fact, in looks like unknown attributes are pruned out, which shouldn't happen (unknown elements are kept, albeit mess up with, see below) 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="8.10">The DOCTYPE and the STYLE I had in this test file were moved from the top and the head to the body, which is really bad. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="8.11">Anyway, join the WAI Authoring Tools working group if you're interested in that kind of issue.
