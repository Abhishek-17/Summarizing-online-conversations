        <Sent id="3.1">It also depends on how the screen reader gets its content - </Sent>
        <Sent id="3.2">readers that are too smart about colours (a useful feature) will realise that the text is invisible and skip it. </Sent>
        <Sent id="3.3">(given the way this is normally used to stuff keywords in pages, it is not a bad practice). </Sent>

        <Sent id="5.1">&amp;gt; Hi All, </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.2">&amp;gt; You could try using a spacer image and then put your message in the alt text. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.3">&amp;gt; I don't know how that will behave in the screenreader but it may help get around the problem with the search engine. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.4">Perhaps not, since putting spider-bait in alt attributes is just as old a search-engine as hiding stuff using colour. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.5">On the other hand there isn't really anyway I can think of for spiders to know whether they are being baited unless there is a lot of repetition of words other than &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the&amp;quot;, etc. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.6">Spider-baiting in itself is quite a problem for users of text, whether sighted text-only users or users of enabling technologies. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.7">I've quite often come across sites with little for a text-only user to read but the keywords they want to be listed over repeated 50 times.</Sent>
