        <Sent id="1.1">hi all, 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.2">As outlined at the face to face meet, I've been working on methods of getting coordinate information about the locations of Semantic web researchers and groups. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.3">I wrote to the www-rdf-interest list asking for data:

        <Sent id="1.4">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2003Apr/0252.html 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.5">so we'll have to see how that pans out. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.6">Please do add yourselves if you've not already there (I just did a few as examples). 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.7">There are some SVG demos, developed from ones by Jim Ley, displaying the information we have already, which I constructed as examples: 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.8">http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/200303/geo/intro.html#demos 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.9">So, now we have to decide on the map which we will use to overlay the dots on. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.10">We want something that will highlight Europe, especially since on a world map, Europe is too small to really show up on provide the level of detail we require. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.11">At ILRT, Caroline Meek, Dan and I have had discussions with a designer, and he has pointed us at some examples, and we've narrowed it down to two that we rather like:

</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.13">which has the advantage of showing Europe as part of the world (we could get rid of the arm of the globe that is showing, and alter the colours); 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.14">and http://www.cadmium.co.uk/thumbs/ds/maps%20and%20globes/t_11407324.jpg.jpg 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.15">which would be technically simpler to do, but shows Europe in isolation (I do like the colour scheme though). 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.16">Do people have a preference for one style over the other? 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.17">Could you let us know today if possible? </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.18">We need to specify the map as soon as possible in order to get postcards printed for www2003. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.19">thanks, 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.20">Libby

        <Sent id="1.21">p.s. Here's a nice similar idea:

        <Sent id="4.1">yeah, sorry it's such a rush. </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.2">It took a long time to write the document explaining how to write the RDF. </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.3">At this stage we really need examples to show the designer though </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.4">- I'll pass your comments along to him, see if he has anything like that.
