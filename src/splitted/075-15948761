        <Sent id="9.1">Actually, the government is not robbing us of our rights, but protecting us. </Sent>
        <Sent id="9.2">i know this sounds paradoxical, but it is true. </Sent>
        <Sent id="9.3">For any NOI (notice of inquiry), NPRM (notice of proposed rule making), etc. the government must follow the procedures established in the apa (i believe it is known as the Americans procedural Act) of 1947, which outlines the procedures of putting the NOI and NPRM out for comment for a specific time period. </Sent>
        <Sent id="9.4">The problem is that when they do this and get a large response to a particular NPRM, they (the government) is obligated to read each and every one of the 
 responses, corrolate them and summarize them into specific response categories, if possible. </Sent>
        <Sent id="9.5">They do this with a limited staff. </Sent>
