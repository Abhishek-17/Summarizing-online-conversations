        <Sent id="4.2">to clear up a possible confusion, can you confirm that you're use of SLD refers to specific learning difficulty or dyslexia, and not Severe Learning Difficulties or cognitive disability? </Sent>

        <Sent id="5.1">hi, </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.2">The paper cover Dyslexia and Dyslexic-like specific learning difficulties. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.3">But it does it does not specifically cover the &amp;quot;learning disabled&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Severe Learning Difficulties&amp;quot; or Cognitive disabilities. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.4">My remit is for those who could be potentially studying at a minimum of a Further Educational level. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.5">You might find that the paper covers many of the issues but it completely side-steps the issues when a student has a savere language difficulty or savere cognition problem... </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.6">I would need to go into talking about the appropriateness of content, symbolic communications. etc etc. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.7">I do hope within the future to write a similar paper about web accessibility for those with hearing impairment (including pre-lingually deaf). </Sent>
