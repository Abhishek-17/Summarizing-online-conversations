        <Sent id="4.2">in addition to including the phone number and time of the call in meeting announcements, could you please email the reminders the day _BEFORE_ the meeting, as it does me little good if i receive a reminder for a meeting shortly before the meeting begins, especially if that is a day where i could spare an hour or so for a telecon, but don't want to get sucked into answering all of my accumulated email!

        <Sent id="6.1">I beleive WAI and assume W3C policy is that meeting announcements, including an agenda should be posted to the list at least 24 hours prior to a telecon meeting. </Sent>
        <Sent id="6.2">I have tried to adhere to this policy in the UA working group and I think it has help keep people interested in the participating in the telecons.
