        <Sent id="5.1">well those are some of the positives, how about disabling for those who are hyperactive, and just cannot stop fiddling with the keyboard? </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.2">its buggy in the sense that for instance 'k' words aren't just those that start with the letter k but also those that include the letter k. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.3">I'd expect it to have a few others besides. </Sent>
