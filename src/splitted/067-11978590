        <Sent id="2.2">&amp;gt; Do you feel we will need the full two days to work on the draft? </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.3">WL: I believe that it is mandatory to discuss states of the draft as they are reached to help avoid possible oversights and conflicts. </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.4">I believe that it will take far more than the two full days to work on the draft and that a meeting involving AU will constitute &amp;quot;working on the draft.&amp;quot; </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.5">I may be the only one who's on five (count 'em 5) Working Groups and even though there is some personnel overlap, the groups do &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; different. </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.6">It (Bristol) is something to look forward to and prepare for. </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.7">I hope it works out because the WAI's influence on the overall W3C and the strength-through-diversity we're achieving is a great model for just about everything and it's starting to bear fruit. </Sent>

        <Sent id="7.1">Thanks Wendy for this really positive response. </Sent>
        <Sent id="7.2">I do hope I have not gone overboard with enthusiasm, and realise that you may all have a few other matters arising. </Sent>
        <Sent id="7.3">I can gassbag on for ever, but would you all (ok most or even some) like to see some commercial graphics/multimedia software designed to be used by Learning Difficulties clients for authoring. </Sent>
        <Sent id="7.4">I have 2 packages in mind, together with a variety of printed documents, from a number of different sources. </Sent>
        <Sent id="7.5">Also, why Bristol, London is a good bit more convenient for me, and a LD client? </Sent>
        <Sent id="7.6">I might also be able to organise a visit to a LD day centre for interested parties. </Sent>
