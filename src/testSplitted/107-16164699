        <Sent id="1.1">Chris Lilley, Brian Stell and others have been discussing the rash of irate, &amp;quot;get me off this list&amp;quot; mesages the listserv has received, lately. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.2">Well, folks: YOU CAN'T UNSUBSCRIBE FROM THIS LIST! </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.3">I've tried for 2 months to get off this list, I've followed the rules, I've tried variations of the theme, looking for some hidden code--all to no avail. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.4">So, the last resort of those who have tried everything else is to post to the list they want to be rid of. </Sent>

        <Sent id="5.1">&amp;gt; It is possible that you are on another mailing list that is sending you the www-font messages. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.2">&amp;gt; If you're on an internal mailing list where you work, for instance, and someone subscribed that list to the www-font list, you may be getting it indirectly, in which case unsubscribing yourself will not get you off the list.</Sent>
        <Sent id="5.3">Thanks for the helpful info, but I just received a message saying that I have been removed from the list. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.4">Why? </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.5">Because I posted my difficulties to the list. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.6">Sorry I had to burden you all with my problems, but as you can see, it worked. </Sent>
